The raw data can be obtained using the 
link below or by downloading the file "NobelData.csv". The file used for the mapping and 
the transformation of the raw data into semantized data through Tarql can be found under 
the name "NobelConstruct.sparql". Finally, the set of semantized data 
(also containing the VoID information) is named "nobel.ttl".

Slides of our presentation (in French) can be found on this GitHub and by clicking on the

Other datasets used in more elaborated queries can be found in the folder with the same name.
